# Shopify-Frontend-Intern-Challenge

You can access my application here: https://rococo-caramel-a1883d.netlify.app

Side note: If you are trying to set up this application locally, you would need your own OPENAI secret key since I've stored mine in environment variables. You can get one here: https://beta.openai.com/signup. Once you have your own, you can go to src/components/Form.js and replace my key with yours.
